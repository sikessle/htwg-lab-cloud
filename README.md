OpenStack based cloud platform for the HTWG Laboraties.

# Branching/Issues

- Branch per feature
- Merge if feature works flawless to master
- GitHub Issues to manage Features, Bugs, etc.

# Project Goals

- Creation of custom virtual machine images which are automatically converted to be OpenStack compatible.
- Fine granular access-right management (per exercise group etc.), which must be configurable by the exercise leader. (LDAP connection with HTWG LDAP and additional Layer?)
- Easy networking configuration per exercise group (inter-group networking and other options)
- Provide block-device per user for a limited time (1 exercice, 1 semester, etc.)
